      <p class="item-name">Paneer</p>
      <p>It’s a fresh, cream-coloured and normally unsalted cheese, historically made from buffalo milk, though a blend of this and cow’s milk is now the norm. It's widely used in north India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh and its mildness is a perfect foil for stronger flavours, which it absorbs easily.Paneer is made without rennet, by curdling hot milk with lemon or lime juice, vinegar, yoghurt or citric acid.  Cubed paneer should be firm so that it doesn’t crumble easily, but not hard, and you should judge a paneer dish by how soft and fluffy the cheese is.Paneer is not always cubed and fried before use. It can be eaten fresh as it is, or crumbled, shaped, moulded and, occasionally, flavoured with cumin or mint.Homemade paneer is the best – it’s easy and quick to prepare, and you really will taste the difference. But if you have to buy the hard, rubbery ready-made variety, immerse in hot water before use. The longer you soak it, the softer it will become.Persian and Afghan rulers introduced paneer to north India in the 16th century. Made from goat or sheep rennet, these cheeses were the predecessors of modern paneer. Indeed sometimes spelt ‘panir’, the word comes from ‘peynir’, the general term for cheese in Persian and Turkish languages.This Mughlai paneer became popular in the rest of India only relatively recently, and now appears in different regional guises. The most famous of this is ‘chhana’ of eastern India, where the drained curds are separated from the whey without using pressure – an unsolid form of paneer.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Dal</p>
      <p>If there is one dish with which Indian cuisine, and in that sense, most Indians, share an umbilical-like connect, it has to be the humble dal. As the Oxford Companion to Food points out, technically the word dal denotes simply a split pulse, but in India it has come to encompass dried beans and peas as well as a thick purée-like stew or soup made from lentils – one of the most adaptable ingredients in an Indian kitchen.An indispensable part of most Indian thalis, dals can also include vegetables, even meat, and there is a world of them, ranging from the most basic (the simple tarka dal found on most restaurant menus) to the decadent (the extraordinary smoky dal makhni).Each state in India has its favourite selection of dal, even though most common ones (like masoor, tur, urad, moong and chana dal) are used pretty much everywhere. Each of these dals are also prepared in different ways in different regions – while they all have an earthy creaminess in common, the fragrant tempering of spices used in each gives them distinctly unique flavours that simply cannot be compared.While every version of this mellow dish is much-loved by Indians for its simple yet deeply comforting taste, the fascinating stories behind their origins are virtually unknown. So if you are a die-hard fan of the humble Indian dal, take things up a notch and tease your taste buds a little more with these interesting tales about this delicious dish.History yields some very interesting facts about dal. Lentil dishes have been known to Indians since very early times. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Indian dal made its first appearance in the Indus Valley Civilization, where lentils – of all kinds – were a staple food.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p>Potatoes are the No. 1 vegetable crop in the United States and the fourth most consumed crop in the world, behind rice, wheat and corn, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Historically, Americans ate most of their potatoes fresh. Since the 1950s, however, processed potatoes — French fries and hash browns, for example — have grown more popular as the technology to freeze the vegetables has improved. According to the USDA, processed potatoes composed 64 percent of total U.S. potato use during the 2000s, compared to 35 percent in the 1960s. Americans, on average, eat 55 lbs. (35 kilograms) of frozen potatoes per year, 42 lbs. (19 kg) of fresh potatoes, 17 lbs. (8 kg) of potato chips and 14 lbs. (6 kg) of dehydrated potato products.Potatoes are often thought of as a comfort food — richly mashed with butter and sour cream or crisply fried in vegetable oil. But when prepared in these ways, they can lead to weight gain, diabetes and heart disease, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. In fact, a study published in 2017 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate fried potatoes twice a week saw an increased risk of death. The study examined potato intake in 4,400 people between the ages of 45 and 79. By the end of the eight-year study, 236 people had died. Researchers found that those who ate fried potatoes — French fries, hash browns, home fries and more — were more than twice as likely to have died. <a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
